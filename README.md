# DCS Lua Datamine
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8382945/115590264-1a3fe300-a314-11eb-9e74-cf76bd60c4f9.png)

## TL/DR

In DCS 2.7 ED has removed most of the lua files in the `Scripts/Database` directory which contained the definitions for most of the rockets, missiles, bombs, warheads and aircraft properties used in the game. For many modders and community members this was a shock since it makes it impossible to see what changes are going on under the hood or to use it as a reference for creating their own weapons/modules.

Because of this I created a script that reads through all the lua tables in the games memory when it launches and writes them out to disk as .lua files for easy reference and for easy comparison with past patches. Since the exported tables are from the games memory there are **no comments** and **no functions**, I've saved some comments from 2.5.6 before the files were removed and put them in [#Comments](https://github.com/Quaggles/dcs-lua-datamine/#comments), this means it can be harder to work out why the values are set to what they are compared to when we had the original lua files. I only included the tables that I determined to contain useful data and that could be structured into files properly, if you have a suggestion log an issue.

I'm planning to keep updating this repository as every Open Beta patch releases.

A quick rundown of the most useful folders and what they contain:

* [_G/warheads](_G/warheads) - Definitions for the warheads used on explosive weapons, sometimes weapon definitions reference files in here (See [#Table-References](https://github.com/Quaggles/dcs-lua-datamine/#table-references))
* [_G/weapons_table/weapons](_G/weapons_table/weapons) - Contains **NEW Weapon API** definitions (AIM-7, AIM-120), look here first for a weapon, if it's not here look below
* [_G/rockets](_G/rockets) - Contains **OLD Weapon API** missile definitions (R-27ER, AIM-54)
* [_G/bombs](_G/bombs) - Contains **OLD Weapon API** bomb definitions
* [_G/db/Units](_G/db/Units) - Definitions for every unit in the game such as airplanes, helicopters, ground units, etc. Useful to find things like RCS, Engine IR values, etc
* [_G/db/Sensors/Sensor](_G/db/Sensors/Sensor) - Definitions for every sensor used by **AI controlled units, repeat, not player aircraft!** (Those values are hidden in the source code for each module on the C++ side)

And here is a link directly to the AIM-120C and the SD-10 incase you want to compare 2 missiles for fun, make sure to read [#Comments](https://github.com/Quaggles/dcs-lua-datamine/#comments) for some explanations of the variables
* [_G/weapons_table/weapons/missiles/AIM_120C.lua](_G/weapons_table/weapons/missiles/AIM_120C.lua)
* [_G/weapons_table/weapons/missiles/SD-10.lua](_G/weapons_table/weapons/missiles/SD-10.lua)

## Installation of the exporter script

Copy the two scripts in [/Hooks](Hooks) and put them in your `Saved Games/DCS/Scripts/Hooks` directory, now just launch the game you should see the following output in the `dcs.log` file if it worked, output tables are in `Saved Games/DCS/DCS.Lua.Exporter/*`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8382945/115797957-7e4bcf80-a418-11eb-88d1-cf5ec340ecae.png)

Note: The exporter can take around 30 seconds to run and will make the game take longer to load, it should automatically detect if a datamine of your version of DCS has been stored and won't repeat it as long as you keep the files in the output folder. If that happens you will see this in the log

## Notes about output lua files

### Indexes
Tables that were indexed with a string key will start like this showing the path to that table relative to _G (Global) 
```lua
_G["weapons_table"]["weapons"]["missiles"]["AIM_120C"] = {
```

Tables that had a number index will start with a line like this
```lua
_G["rockets"]["#Index"] = {
```

The reason for this is that patch to patch the # index will change and will clutter up the git diff so I replace it with that placeholder string instead

### Table References

In the original source files table references were easy to spot, for example in the GBU-24 definition you would see the line:
```lua
warhead = warheads["Mk_84"],
```
This made it obvious that this weapon used the same warhead as the Mk-84. However in the games memory we don't know the direction of the table references, i.e. we don't know that the Mk-84 warhead was defined in the warheads table, we just know that there are many references to it in other tables all throughout memory.

So instead inside the Mk-84 and GBU-24 bomb definitions they would contain these identical warhead tables:
```lua
...
name = "GBU_24",
type = 4,
warhead = {
  caliber = 457,
  concrete_factors = { 1, 1, 1 },
  concrete_obj_factor = 0,
  cumulative_factor = 0,
  cumulative_thickness = 0,
  expl_mass = 340,
  mass = 340,
  obj_factors = { 1, 1 },
  other_factors = { 1, 1, 1 },
  piercing_mass = 68
}
...
```

To help make the table references easier to follow the tool automatically scans for all table references and designates the instance with the shallowest depth in global as the original, any other references to that exact table pointer look like so: 
```lua
...
name = "GBU_24",
type = 4,
warhead = "_G/warheads/Mk_84.lua",
...
  ```

Note, these nice references only work if the tables are exact references in memory, if another weapon definition used a "Deep Copy" of the table (Copied all the values off it and inserted it into a fresh table) there is no way to connect them logically. For example the bombs in the `bombs` table typically reference fine, those in `_G\weapons_table\weapons\bombs` are usually deep copied.

### Redacted Values

In the lua tables some values are very volitile and will change nearly every DCS patch by themselves for various reasons when the code is compiled, they don't have any gameplay impact. To avoid cluttering up the git diff and making them easier to read some values are replaced with the `"Redacted"` string. One example of this is the final number in the `ws_type` table which is a unique ID for the type and will change typically every patch.
```lua
	type = 4,
	warhead = "_G/warheads/Mk_84.lua",
	ws_type = { 4, 5, 36, "Redacted" }
```

## Comments
Some comments I extracted from the 2.5.6 scripts that explain some of the variables, these were google translated from Russian so good luck

### _G/warheads
```lua
-- Description of coefficients

--[[
expl_mass = 2.0
The mass of explosive in the warhead of the ammunition in kilograms

 other_factors = { HE1, HE2, HE3};
High-explosive action coefficients when hitting the ground:
HE1. – high-explosive damaging effect (expl_mass *HE1)
HE2. - explosion effect size
HE3. - the size of the funnel from the explosion

 concrete_factors = { HE1, HE2, HE3},
High-explosive action coefficients when hitting concrete:
HE1 - explosive damaging effect (expl_mass *HE1)
HE2 - explosion effect size
HE3 - explosion crater size

 concrete_obj_factor = cp,
Coefficients of concrete-penetrating action when it hits concrete:
CP - concrete-penetrating effect for concrete-piercing ammunition (expl_mass *CP)

 obj_factors = { HE1, HE2 },
High-explosive action coefficient when it hits a ground object (equipment):
HE1 - explosive damaging effect (expl_mass *HE1)
HE2 - explosion effect size

 cumulative_factor=SC,
SC - cumulative effect for cumulative ammunition (expl_mass *SC)
 cumulative_thickness = TH
TH - the maximum thickness of the armor that the cumulative part of the damage can penetrate (in meters).
     If the unit's armor is greater, then the cumulative damage is not applied.


Let us assume that the warhead of a conditional bomb has an explosive mass of 10 kg.

The bomb has the following coefficients:

obj_factors = {0.5, 1},
concrete_factors = {0.8, 1, 1},
other_factors = {0.9, 1, 1},
cumulative_factor = 5,
concrete_obj_factor = 3
cumulative_thickness = 0.05

then,

1. if the bomb falls into the ground, then the explosive effect will be 10 * 0.9 = 9
2. if the bomb falls on a concrete object, then the explosive effect will be 10 * 0.8, plus an additional 3 * 10 = 30 more concrete-piercing damaging effects are transferred to this object
3. if the bomb hits the car, then the high-explosive effect will be 10 * 0.5,
    plus additionally 5*10=50 more cumulative damaging effects are transferred to this object if the armor of the vehicle is less than 5 cm.

In order not to write large tables for each warhead, there is the simple_warhead function, which takes one parameter - the mass of explosives. The output is a conventional warhead with a high-explosive fragmentation effect.
